Hey there! I'm wania maham, and I'm embarking on an exciting journey into the world of TypeScript! 
I'm a passionate learner eager to dive deep into the realm of web development and JavaScript. TypeScript caught my eye because of its ability to bring structure, type safety, and scalability to my projects, and I'm thrilled to explore its potential!
As a beginner, I see TypeScript as a fantastic tool to level up my JavaScript skills. Its static typing and robust tooling not only improve code quality but also enhance my development workflow. Plus, it's widely adopted in the industry, making it a valuable skill to have!
