// // If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, 
// // just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the program does.

// // SO, this is Wania;
// // this program prints a personal message.
// let teacherName:string = "Sir ameen alam"
// let message = `'HELLO ${teacherName}! thank you so much for teaching us very well with the great thoughts 
// May ALLAH give you more sucess and also the students who put effort on it including me.IN SHA ALLAH'`
